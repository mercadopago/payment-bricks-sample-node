# Payment processing with Checkout Bricks

## :computer: Technologies

- Node.js
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) (dependency manager)
- Express

## ðŸ’¡ Requirements

- Node.js 10 or higher (you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/)).
- [Read our instructions](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers/en/docs/getting-started) on how to create an application at the Mercado Pago Developer Panel in order to acquire your public key and access token. They will grant you access to Mercado Pago's public APIs.

## :gear: Installation

1. Clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AleFossati/payment-bricks-sample-node.git
```

2. Go to the project's folder.

```bash
cd payment-bricks-sample-node
```

3. Then install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## ðŸŒŸ How to run it

1. Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
npm run localtunnel
``` 

2. Copy the generated URL: _(it may take a few seconds to show the URL)_

3. Keep the previous terminal instance running and open a new one. In the new terminal instance, run the following command:

```bash
HOST=YOUR-URL MERCADO_PAGO_SAMPLE_PUBLIC_KEY=YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY MERCADO_PAGO_SAMPLE_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN npm start
``` 

4. Remember to replace `YOUR-URL` with the URL from the step 2, `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` and `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the corresponding [credentials](https://www.mercadopago.com/developers/panel) from your account.

5. Navigate to `YOUR-URL` from step 2 in your browser. In your first access to this URL, you will be prompted with a warning page. You'll need to inform your public IP Address, but don't worry, the warning page shows you how you can do that. Then paste your public IP in the input field and  **"Click to Submit"**.

6. That's all, now you can access your localhost running app through the URL exposed by localtunnel.
